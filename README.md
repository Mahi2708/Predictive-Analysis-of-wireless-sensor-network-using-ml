# Predictive Analysis of Wireless Sensor Networks Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project focuses on applying **machine learning (ML) techniques** to analyze and predict behaviors in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). By leveraging sensor data and ML models, we aim to **detect anomalies, predict failures, and optimize network performance** in real time.

## Objectives
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gather real-time sensor data, clean, and preprocess it for effective ML model training.
2. **Feature Engineering & Model Selection:** Identify key patterns in sensor data and apply ML algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks to predict network conditions.
3. **Performance Optimization & Deployment:** Enhance prediction accuracy, minimize false positives, and deploy the trained model for real-time decision-making in WSN environments.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (Recommended: Python 3.x)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Wireless sensor network dataset or real-time sensor integration

## Setup Instructions
1. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
